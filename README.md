# ONNX Runtime Build

This project is to build custom [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai) libraries which are not provided in [the official releases](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases).

Currently supports static library builds only with the default options.

## Building Libraries

- [Requirements for building ONNX Runtime for Web](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/inferencing.html#prerequisites) (for Wasm build)
- Bash
  - On Windows, you can use Git Bash provided by [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
